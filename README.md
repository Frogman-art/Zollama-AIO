Enhance your prompts, re image a picture, re create a picture with a theme, bypass system prompts, use Z image Turbo as normal ( use your own prompts ) 
I once accidently forgot to disable load image when I asked it to create a picture of a futuristic car with prompt enhancement and it incorporated the loaded image 
design into the paint job which was an interesting accident.

Sometimes the AI doesn't follow the system prompts so could do with some fine tuning, if you can come up with better ones, id love to see them but for the most part, mine work ok.

Leaving "thinking" on gets better results and its cool to see its thought process.
One of my fav things to do is to upload a meme, leave the prompt blank and hit run.
