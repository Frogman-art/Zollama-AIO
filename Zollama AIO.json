First, the main subject is a character from a video game, probably Street Fighter, since it's a classic Capcom character. Let's start with the character's appearance.\n\nThe character is a man with a muscular build. He's standing in a confident pose with arms crossed. His skin tone is light, maybe a bit tanned, and he's white, so ethnicity-wise, he's likely Caucasian. His body type is very muscular, especially the arms and shoulders, which are emphasized by his red uniform.\n\nHe's wearing a red military-style uniform. The top is a tight-fitting red shirt with dark blue or black accents on the collar and sleeves. The pants are also red, matching the shirt. The belt is dark blue, with a gold emblem that looks like an 'S' or a lightning bolt, maybe the symbol for Sheng. The helmet is red with a dark visor, and there's a red cap on his head, which is part of the uniform. The cape is long, green, flowing behind him. He's also wearing knee-high boots that are silver and black, with the top part being silver and the soles black.\n\nNow, emotions: he's smiling broadly, showing his teeth, which gives a confident, cheerful expression. His posture is strong and upright, arms crossed, which adds to the confident vibe.\n\nArtistic style: It's a typical 2D anime/manga style for video game character art. The lines are clean, with shading that gives a 3D feel but still flat in terms of depth, common in Capcom's fighting game art. The colors are vibrant, with the red uniform, green cape, and silver armor standing out.\n\nBody positions: He's standing straight, arms crossed over his chest. The cape is flowing behind him, slightly to the left (from the viewer's perspective), so it's in motion. The boots are positioned so that the feet are planted, maybe a slight angle, but mostly straight.\n\nAccessories: The belt has a prominent emblem, the cap is on his head, the helmet is part of the cap. The cape is attached to his shoulders, flowing down. The armor on the shoulders and arms is silver, matching the boots.\n\nCaptions: There are no captions in the image, just the character. The background is white, so it's a clean, isolated character portrait.\n\nWait, the user said not to mention origins or meaning, just describe the image. Let's check again: skin tone, ethnicity, body types, emotions, positions, clothing details, artistic style, any captions. No mention of what the image is, but the user says if there are modifications, but in this case, the image is as given.\n\nWait, the image is of Sheng, a character from Street Fighter. But I need to avoid mentioning that. Just describe the visual elements.\n\nLet me structure it:\n\nCharacter: A male figure with a strong, muscular build. Light skin tone, Caucasian ethnicity.\n\nFace: Smiling broadly, eyes are not visible (since he's wearing a visor), but the expression is confident. The visor is dark, maybe black, covering the eyes, but the smile is visible.\n\nBody: Standing upright, arms crossed over chest. Muscular arms, chest, shoulders. The posture is confident, showing strength.\n\nClothing: Red uniform. Top is a tight red shirt with dark blue accents on the collar and shoulders. The sleeves have silver arm guards (part of the uniform, maybe). The pants are red, matching the top. A dark blue belt with a gold emblem (looks like a stylized 'S' or lightning bolt). The hat is red, with a dark visor, similar to a military cap. A long green cape flowing behind him, attached at the shoulders. Knee-high boots: silver on the upper part, black on the lower part (the soles and heels). The boots have a slight armor-like design.\n\nAccessories: The cape is tied at the shoulders, flowing to the back. The belt is around the waist, with the emblem centered. The cap is worn on his head.\n\nArtistic style: 2D digital art with anime/manga influences, typical of Capcom's character designs. Shading is used to give depth, but the style is flat with bold outlines. Colors are vibrant, with red, green, and silver contrasting against the white background.\n\nPositions: The character is centered in the frame. His arms are crossed, so the hands are clasped behind his chest. The cape flows to the right side (from the viewer's perspective), slightly curved. His feet are positioned with the toes pointing forward, but the boots are slightly angled, showing the front and sides.\n\nSkin tone: Light, with subtle shading to show the muscle definition.\n\nEthnicity: Caucasian, based on the skin tone and features.\n\nNo captions present in the image; the background is plain white, which is common for character portraits to isolate the subject.\n\nLet me check if I missed anything. The user said to describe in detail, including emotions, body types, positions, skin tone, ethnicity, artistic styles, themes, clothing details, accessories, captions. So:\n\n- Emotions: Confident, cheerful (from the smile and posture).\n\n- Body type: Muscular, especially arms and chest; stocky but athletic.\n\n- Body positions: Standing upright, arms crossed, cape flowing.\n\n- Skin tone: Light, maybe slightly tanned.\n\n- Ethnicity: Caucasian.\n\n- Artistic style: 2D anime/manga style with bold outlines, vibrant colors, and shading for depth.\n\n- Clothing: Red uniform with dark blue accents, silver shoulder pads and arm guards, green cape, dark blue belt with gold emblem, red cap with visor, silver and black boots.\n\n- Accessories: Cape attached at shoulders, belt with emblem, cap on head.\n\n- Captions: None.\n\nI think that covers it. Let's put it all together in a coherent description."],"color":"#232","bgcolor":"#353"},{"id":50,"type":"Fast Groups Muter (rgthree)","pos":[2738.3902272003547,-2342.1526276357554],"size":[236.44294612592557,62.56724241174811],"flags":{},"order":4,"mode":0,"inputs":[],"outputs":[{"name":"OPT_CONNECTION","type":"*","links":null}],"title":"Ollama","properties":{"matchColors":"","matchTitle":"Ollama Gen","showNav":true,"showAllGraphs":true,"sort":"position","customSortAlphabet":"","toggleRestriction":"default"},"color":"#432","bgcolor":"#653"},{"id":30,"type":"PrimitiveStringMultiline","pos":[2494.6296918192247,-2503.662598333777],"size":[346.7211592883459,236.90420006455997],"flags":{"collapsed":true},"order":5,"mode":2,"inputs":[{"localized_name":"value","name":"value","type":"STRING","widget":{"name":"value"},"link":null}],"outputs":[{"localized_name":"STRING","name":"STRING","type":"STRING","links":[50]}],"title":"Prompt enhancement","properties":{"cnr_id":"comfy-core","ver":"0.3.75","Node name for S&R":"PrimitiveStringMultiline"},"widgets_values":["You are a Stable Diffusion prompt generator.
